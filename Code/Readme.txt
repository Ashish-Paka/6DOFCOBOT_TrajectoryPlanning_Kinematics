TOPIC: FORWARD KINEMATICS, INVERSE KINEMATICS & TRAJECTORY PLANNING IN A 6 DOF COBOT ROBOT

DESCRIPTION:
This project explores the simulation and control of a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6 DOF) Collaborative Robot (COBOT). It focuses on forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, trajectory planning, and operational space plotting to understand the robot's spatial movements and enhance its task execution capabilities.


INSTALLATION:
To run this project, ensure you have MATLAB (https://www.mathworks.com/) installed. Additionally, you need to install the Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke and the MATLAB Robotics Toolbox.

1. Download and install the Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke from [here](https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/).
2. Ensure that you have the [MATLAB Robotics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html) installed. You can install it using MATLAB's Add-On Explorer or by downloading it from the MathWorks website.
2. Change to the project directory in MATLAB.


PROCEDURE:
Follow the steps below to run the code successfully:

1. Open MATLAB:
   - Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your machine along with the mentioned Toolboxes.

2. Open the Code File:
   - Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open and Save the Code:
   - Open 'code file script' in MATLAB.
   - Save the script to ensure any changes are captured.

4. Execute the Code:
   - In MATLAB, run the script by selecting the run arrow under the editor section
     
     This will execute the script and initiate the simulations.

5. Input Parameters:
   - Follow on-screen prompts or input any required parameters as instructed by the script.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the "Need Help?" section in this README file for our contact information.


FEATURES:
1. Simulating Trajectory Planning
2. Simulating/Plotting the Operational Workspace
   ---NOTE---Optimal operational space simulations are achieved with 'num = 8' points. Use values between 4-7 for faster results.
3. Analytical and Linear Jacobian Calculation
4. Joint Velocities and Accelerations Along the Path
